## Cura Learning: Experimental Education Programs

I founded [**Cura Learning**](https://curalearning.org/), an edTech company that focuses on taking a scientific approach curriculum development so students can speak confidently and think critically. Cura Learning represents the practical implementation of my research in experimental education design.

**Student Results:** Cura learning students have won several state and national level debate tournaments and championships, as well as admissions into several Ivy+ universities.

## Other Teaching Highlights
**Minnetonka High School - Speech and Debate Program Advisor**
- Led team to win [2019 Schools of Excellence in Debate](https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2019-School-Awards-Updated.pdf) at the National Speech and Debate Association National Tournament
- Students achieved: 3rd in Nationals, 2nd in State, 1st MDTA Cup, 6+ regional champions, 2 MN Debate Student of the Year awards

- **Minnesota Minghua Chinese School** - Summer programs

## Professional Work Experience

With over 7 years of professional experience, I've built a career spanning operations, manufacturing, and software engineering. I started at **3M** as an Operations Engineer on manufacturing lines and advanced to Manufacturing Lead for a global supply chain. In 2020, I transitioned to software engineering at **Chewy.com**, where I worked on warehouse management systems (WMS) for e-commerce logistics. Currently, I'm a WMS Developer at **Resmed**, developing and maintaining WMS solutions for healthcare supply chain operations. My technical expertise spans supply chain, logistics, manufacturing, software engineering, and system design, with research applications in NLP, computer vision, causal inference, and experimental design.

### Impact & Recognition
I have been blessed to work with many brilliant students who have moved on to become great scientists, business leaders, doctors, and many others who are still finding their calling. The success of my students and the impact of evidence-based educational approaches continue to drive my work in both research and practice.
