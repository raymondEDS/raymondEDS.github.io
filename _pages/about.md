Welcome to my website! My name is Raymond and I am an engineer, machine learning researcher, and most importantly an **educator**. Feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raymondzeds/) and my [GitHub](https://github.com/raymondEDS) and do not be afraid to reach out if you have any questions or potential collaborations! I am open to collaborating in machine learning in my domain expertise (NLP, Supply Chain, Education), teaching public speaking, or software development work. 

Work Experience
======
Professionally, I have worked as an engineer in the supply chain/logistics/manufacturing domain for 5+ years! I started my full-time career on the front lines of manufacturing lines at [3M](https://www.3m.com/) as an operations engineer, then worked my way to corporate where I became the manufacturing lead for a global supply chain. In 2020, I made a career change to software engineering working on warehouse management systems (WMS) for [Chewy.com](https://www.chewy.com/). Currently, I work as an advanced specialist developer (senior-level software engineer) for [Resmed](https://www.resmed.com/en-us/) as the lead developer for the WMS system.

Research Experience
======
While completing my master's studies at the Stanford Graduate School of Education, I was fortunate enough to have worked on the following projects. With Professor [Daniel McFarland](https://profiles.stanford.edu/daniel-mcfarland) at the [Mimir Knowledge Creation Lab](https://mimir.stanford.edu/research), we were able to publish a paper on how peer-review policies caused review scores to change to *Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics*. Additionally, I worked on a computer vision project between Professor [Nick Haber](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/nhaber) of the [Stanford Autonomous Agents Lab](https://www.autonomousagents.stanford.edu/people) and Professor [Phil Fisher](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/philf) of the [Stanford Center on Early Childhood](https://earlychildhood.stanford.edu/), where our primary findings was invited to be presented at *University of California, Berkeley's Institute of Human Development Flash Talks*.

Prior to graduate school, I worked with Professor [BoDong Chen](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/faculty-directory/bchen) of the [University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education Wonder Lab](https://penn-wonderlab.github.io/) on publishing literature review on social annotation.
