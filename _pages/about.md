Welcome to my website! My name is Raymond and I am an engineer, machine learning researcher, and most importantly an **educator**. Feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raymondzeds/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/raymondEDS) and do not be afraid to reach out if you have any questions or potential collaborations! I am open to collaborating on machine learning work in my domain of expertise (NLP, Computer Vision, Causal Inference, Experimental Design, Supply Chain, Education), teaching public speaking, or software development work. 

Work Experience
======
Professionally, I have worked as an engineer in the supply chain/logistics/manufacturing domain for 5+ years! I started my full-time career on the front lines of manufacturing lines at [3M](https://www.3m.com/) as an operations engineer, then worked my way to corporate where I became the manufacturing lead for a global supply chain. In 2020, I made a career change to software engineering working on warehouse management systems (WMS) for [Chewy.com](https://www.chewy.com/). Currently, I work as the developer for [Resmed](https://www.resmed.com/en-us/)'s WMS.

Research Experience
======
While completing my master's studies at the Stanford Graduate School of Education, I was fortunate enough to have worked on the following projects. With Professor [Daniel McFarland](https://profiles.stanford.edu/daniel-mcfarland) at the [Mimir Knowledge Creation Lab](https://mimir.stanford.edu/research), we were able to publish a paper on how peer-review policies caused review scores to change to *Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics*. Additionally, I worked on a computer vision project between Professor [Nick Haber](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/nhaber) of the [Stanford Autonomous Agents Lab](https://www.autonomousagents.stanford.edu/people) and Professor [Phil Fisher](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/philf) of the [Stanford Center on Early Childhood](https://earlychildhood.stanford.edu/), where our preliminary findings was presented at *University of California, Berkeley's Institute of Human Development Flash Talks*.

Prior to graduate school, I worked with Professor [BoDong Chen](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/faculty-directory/bchen) of the [University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education Wonder Lab](https://penn-wonderlab.github.io/) on publishing literature review on social annotation.


Teaching Experience
------
Most importantly, I have worked directly with students ranging from 5th grade to graduate students as a coach/mentor since 2013. I was the Speech and Debate program advisor for Minnetonka High School where my team won the [2019 Schools of Excellence in Debate](https://www.speechanddebate.org/wp-content/uploads/2019-School-Awards-Updated.pdf) at the National Speech and Debate Association National Tournament. It was a great privilege to work with students who placed 3rd in Nationals, 2nd in State, 1st MDTA Cup, 6+ regional champions, and 2 MN Debate Student of the Year.

During graduate school, I taught 2 summers at [Minnesota Minghua Chinese School](https://www.minghuaedu.org/) and the Stanford [STHEM](https://compression.stanford.edu/outreach/shtem-summer-internships-high-schoolers-and-community-college-students) where my mentees published their own independent research paper on [child's emotional literacy](https://theinformaticists.com/2022/10/03/improving-childrens-social-and-emotional-literacy-using-nlp-based-emotional-detection/).


I am excited to announce a new collaboration with [SR20](https://www.sr20academy.com/public-speaking-and-debating-program) to promote English public speaking and professional development in a foreign language learning context! Additionally, my team has developed a custom curriculum in STEM entrepreneurship and machine learning research to service both domestic and international students alike! We are really excited to work with you all!

I have been blessed by working with so many brilliant students who moved on to become great scientists, business leaders, doctors, and many yet to find their calling!
